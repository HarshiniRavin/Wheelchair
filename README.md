# Wheelchair
People who are suffering from disease like paralysis, polio or from some accident and loss their hands and legs need some artificial source with the help of which they can move. In order to minimize their problem we have developed a “smart wheelchair” which will operate on the voice commands from the handicapped user for movement purpose the voice commands of the handicapped  will be first saved in the voice recognition module before using it so that other person from outside cannot give command to it. As additional features we are also using joystick and sensors so to provide more protection to the user. It will be helpful to handicapped persons due to different reasons. When handicapped is using simple wheel chair they face many problems which can cause many accidents. Mostly simple wheel chair is drive by the handicapped through has hands. We are designing such wheel chair that will provide extra safety features that prevent common wheelchair accidents. Because we are using voice commands, sensors and also joystick it will minimize the accidents. We are developing such a wheel chair that will be helpful for handicapped in hospitals or nursing home settings feel safer about their surroundings.
